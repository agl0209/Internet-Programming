For this project i used Microsoft expression web 4 as i have some experience and find it the easiest to use out of all of them. To access the webpage you will need a browser such as Chrome or Edge.
The purpose of this project is to get us fammiliar with GitHub so that for future asssignments it has become second nature.
Abstract
For this assignment i chose to do a small fact file on the great white shark as it is my favourite animal.

Intro
I used a simple image of a great white shark. i changed the background colour of the webpage to blue and i changed the text to white.

# Method
## Tools Used
The first tool i used was the align text function for the title (align="center") then i made the font size xx-large (style="font-size: xx-large") after that for the Latin name of the shark i put that in italics (<em>carchadon carcharias </em>.)
For the first paragraph of text i made the font smaller with the tag (style="font-size: x-large".)
To insert the image i first saved a picture to my computer and then placed it in my webpage at the desired size using the tag (img alt="" height="503" src="gwshark.jpg" width="788".)
I change the back ground colour and the text colour by using the tag (body style="color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #0000ff".)
## Programming Language

## System Requirements
A system that supports html5 or above. An internet browser such as chrome or edge.
